# AI Swarm - Driver OpenAI

This is a driver for the AI Swarm that uses the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API to provide a LLM for the AI Swarm. It handles all communication with any agents running in the swarm using the OpenAI API. The driver does not run on its own, it must be used with the [Orchestrator](https://github.com/aiswarm/orchestrator). 

If you're looking for an easy way to get started with the AI Swarm, check out the [Conductor](https://github.com/aiswarm/conductor) project.

## Project setup for development
